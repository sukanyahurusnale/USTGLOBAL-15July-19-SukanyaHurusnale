      <p class="card-text">Art galleries are in the business of aesthetics,
         yet it’s amazing how generic and uninventive many of their websites can be.
          Minimal graphics, fonts, and color schemes are designed to keep the viewer’s focus on the art itself,
           often at the expense of creativity and attractiveness. As in any business,
         it’s important for galleries to make a website that stands out and is memorable.
         The websites on this list have achieved that goal by making subtle, yet integral design choices that, in fact, often increase both functionality and the viewing experience.

          Beautiful Art Gallery Websites for Inspiration
        </u>
      </h3>
      <p class="galleries">The websites below are useful sources of inspiration, and they prove that there are multiple variations on similar themes which can be used when you make a website. They show the array of choices that designers have and the ways in which sophisticated, intricate, or visually interesting graphics can actually enhance the look of the art, not counteract it. By creating a balance between the work being sold and the design format, art galleries have the potential to optimize their website as a marketing tool and therefore increase their business.</p>

      <p class="galleries">While many gallery websites take the minimalist approach, the Pace Gallery is not afraid to include elements of color, pattern, and interactive functions in a bulletin-like format. Their web page background images consist of a pale purple number “50,” in celebration of their 50th anniversary in 2010. Without tabs or links to separate sections, instead the gallery’s information is laid out in a series of boxes, with sections on artists, exhibitions, press releases, media, locations, books, news, and about the gallery. Click on an artist and the artists’ box transforms. Select the option to “expand” and the entire web page layout changes, so that sections where additional information appears are highlighted (perhaps old press releases, books, and the current exhibition), while irrelevant sections (maybe media or events) are darkened. It’s a unique system devised so that those looking for information on a specific person or exhibition can avoid skipping from section to section and, instead, find all the information they need laid out in one place.</p>

<img src="/image/jabong_image/bagwfi-13intsantshift.jpg alt="pace_gallery">
<p class="galleries">The Von Bartha website screams sophistication.
   With pared down images and a strong font,
    they show how simplicity doesn’t have to be boring, 
    but instead can be quite evocative. With a palette of black, white, and sky blue,
     the homepage opens with three clean squares showing shots of each of the gallery’s 
     locations and titled with the name of their current exhibitions. A strong, bold Von Bartha 
     logo dominates the upper-right-hand corner of each subsequently linked page,
      while the web page background color alternates between white and black depending on the section. 
      One visually notable choice occurs in the artists’ section, where each name is highlighted in a chunk of the 
      same eye-catching blue.

</h4>
<img src="/image/jabong_image/bagwfi-16.jpg" alt="pace_gallery">
<p class="galleries">Mitchell-Innes & Nash’s website inserts the viewer into their actual gallery space. 
  Different views of the gallery provide the consistent backdrop to the web page design, 
  yet the site remains dynamic with drop-down menus, shading, and website Flash templates 
  that enable dynamic movement as images shift and pages turn. Perhaps one of the most interesting
   features here can be found in the artists’ section; browsing through images becomes a
    much more dynamic task, as each work appears projected against the gallery walls,
     rather than a solid background or color. The result is as though you are viewing the 
     work actually hung up in the gallery space, a sensation which is almost interactive in its effect.
   This gallery knows how to make a website that is both straightforward and functional,
    but yet subtly involves the viewer..
